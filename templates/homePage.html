<!-- This is the content/html for the home page. The navigation bar appears at the top because we are extending the layout.html
which contains the navBar.html and styling. From there we add the additional components for the homepage. The first part is the homepage
image which contains the text of our mission. The second half of the homepage is the Upcoming Events panel which queries and shows all of the
events that are coming up in the next week. -->
