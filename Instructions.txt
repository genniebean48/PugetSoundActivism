Instructions for writing and running the app with flask:
2/18/21


To run:
If you haven't already installed it, you need to have flask installed.
You should only need to do this once.
    On the command line run:
        pip install Flask
Then you need to tell Flask which file to run as the application.
On my system, I have to do this each time I restart my command line interface.
    On the command line, run:
        export FLASK_APP=application.py
To run, make sure you are in the directory with application.py in it.
    On the command line, run:
        flask run


General structure:
|-Project folder/
| |--application.py
| |--Instructions.txt
| |--README
| |--templates/
| |  |--all html files
| |--static/
| |  |--all less files
| |  |--all css files
| |  |--all js files
| |  |--images/
| |  |  |--all images
| |  |--Gennie's fonts folder/
| |  |  |--whatever goes in that (I think she downloaded it?)

So generally, the html files go in templates, the less and js file
go in static, and the images go in static/images.


To link to other pages:
Right now, the home page is on route "/", the club pages are
on route "/clubPage", and the login page is on route "/login".

If you want to add a page, we need to add a route in application.py.
For example, to add a route called createAccount to run an html file called
createAccount.html, in application.py, add:
    @app.route("/createAccount")
    def createAccount():
        return render_template("createAccount.html")

To go to other pages (with href or src or whatever else), use the routes above.
So if you want to link to the home page, use "/", to the login use "/login",
etc.


To link other files (in html files):

To link a less/css/js file (called, for example, style.less), in your href or src
or whatever, use the syntax:
{{ url_for('static', filename='style.less') }}

If that file is in a subdirectory inside static, put the subdirectory names
right before the file name. For example, if you want an image called ups.jpg in
static/images, use:
{{ url_for('static', filename='images/ups.jpg') }}

NOTE- this syntax only works inside html files, not less or js files
